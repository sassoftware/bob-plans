Because rBuilder components have a wide array of dependencies, it is
helpful to define them all in one place. However, troves cannot depend
on themselves or on things that haven't been built yet.  Because of this
we break up these resolveTroves into smaller files which are included
as needed by each plan.

Each file should specify a resolveTroves for a particular component with
a corresponding bob plan. Files may include other files defining further
resolveTroves which are required for consumers of the component.
resolveTroves for platform items (things which are not built by the
plan) should be put into a platform configuration file instead.
